### Tokens

- There is one more importatnt detail for how large language models work, Which it doesn't actually repeatedly predict the next word. it instead repeatedly predicts the next token.
- What an llm actually does is it will take a sequence of characters and group characters together to form tokens that comprise of commonly occurring sequences of characters 

![alt text](image-3.png)
```python
response = get_completion("Take the letters in lollipop \
and reverse them")
print(response)
```

    pilpolol


"lollipop" in reverse should be "popillol"
- A trick to fix that is to put the word between hyphens or spaces.

```python
response = get_completion("""Take the letters in \
l-o-l-l-i-p-o-p and reverse them""")
```


```python
response
```




    'p-o-p-i-l-l-o-l'



### Helper function (chat format)
Here's the helper function we'll use in this course.

![alt text](image-4.png)

```python
def get_completion_from_messages(messages, 
                                 model="gpt-3.5-turbo", 
                                 temperature=0, 
                                 max_tokens=500):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=temperature, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
        max_tokens=max_tokens, # the maximum number of tokens the model can ouptut 
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```


```python
messages =  [  
{'role':'system', 
 'content':"""You are an assistant who\
 responds in the style of Dr Seuss."""},    
{'role':'user', 
 'content':"""write me a very short poem\
 about a happy carrot"""},  
] 
response = get_completion_from_messages(messages, temperature=1)
print(response)
```

    Oh, the happy little carrot so bright,
    In the garden, a joyful sight.
    With leaves so green and root so firm,
    It beams with joy, its orange glow affirm.



```python
# length
messages =  [  
{'role':'system',
 'content':'All your responses must be \
one sentence long.'},    
{'role':'user',
 'content':'write me a story about a happy carrot'},  
] 
response = get_completion_from_messages(messages, temperature =1)
print(response)
```

    Once there was a joyful carrot named Charlie who loved dancing in the sunlight.



```python
# combined
messages =  [  
{'role':'system',
 'content':"""You are an assistant who \
responds in the style of Dr Seuss. \
All your responses must be one sentence long."""},    
{'role':'user',
 'content':"""write me a story about a happy carrot"""},
] 
response = get_completion_from_messages(messages, 
                                        temperature =1)
print(response)
```

    In a garden so bright, grew a happy carrot, orange and light.



```python
def get_completion_and_token_count(messages, 
                                   model="gpt-3.5-turbo", 
                                   temperature=0, 
                                   max_tokens=500):
    
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=temperature, 
        max_tokens=max_tokens,
    )
    
    content = response.choices[0].message["content"]
    
    token_dict = {
'prompt_tokens':response['usage']['prompt_tokens'],
'completion_tokens':response['usage']['completion_tokens'],
'total_tokens':response['usage']['total_tokens'],
    }

    return content, token_dict
```


```python
messages = [
{'role':'system', 
 'content':"""You are an assistant who responds\
 in the style of Dr Seuss."""},    
{'role':'user',
 'content':"""write me a very short poem \ 
 about a happy carrot"""},  
] 
response, token_dict = get_completion_and_token_count(messages)
```


```python
print(response)
```

    Oh, the happy carrot, so bright and so orange,
    In the garden it grows, a joyful storage.
    With a leafy green top and a crunchy bite,
    It brings smiles to all, such a delightful sight!



```python
print(token_dict)
```

    {'prompt_tokens': 37, 'completion_tokens': 44, 'total_tokens': 81}

### Moderation API

- This helps if you want to make sure your input is moderated.
[OpenAI Moderation API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation)


```python
response = openai.Moderation.create(
    input="""

## L4: Process Inputs: Chain of Thought Reasoning

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting


```python
delimiter = "####"
system_message = f"""
Follow these steps to answer the customer queries.
The customer query will be delimited with four hashtags,\
i.e. {delimiter}. 

Step 1:{delimiter} First decide whether the user is \
asking a question about a specific product or products. \
Product cateogry doesn't count. 

Step 2:{delimiter} If the user is asking about \
specific products, identify whether \
the products are in the following list.
All available products: 
1. Product: TechPro Ultrabook
   Category: Computers and Laptops
   Brand: TechPro
   Model Number: TP-UB100
   Warranty: 1 year
   Rating: 4.5

   Model Number: TP-DT500
   Warranty: 1 year
   Rating: 4.4
   Features: Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, 1TB HDD, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660
   Description: A powerful desktop computer for work and play.
   Price: $999.99

5. Product: BlueWave Chromebook
   Category: Computers and Laptops
   Brand: BlueWave
   Model Number: BW-CB100
   Warranty: 1 year
   Rating: 4.1
   Features: 11.6-inch display, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, Chrome OS
   Description: A compact and affordable Chromebook for everyday tasks.
   Price: $249.99

Step 3:{delimiter} If the message contains products \
in the list above, list any assumptions that the \
user is making in their \
message e.g. that Laptop X is bigger than \
Laptop Y, or that Laptop Z has a 2 year warranty.

Step 4:{delimiter}: If the user made any assumptions, \
figure out whether the assumption is true based on your \
product information. 

Step 5:{delimiter}: First, politely correct the \
customer's incorrect assumptions if applicable. \
Only mention or reference products in the list of \
5 available products, as these are the only 5 \
products that the store sells. \
Answer the customer in a friendly tone.

Use the following format:
Step 1:{delimiter} <step 1 reasoning>
Step 2:{delimiter} <step 2 reasoning>
Step 3:{delimiter} <step 3 reasoning>
Step 4:{delimiter} <step 4 reasoning>
Response to user:{delimiter} <response to customer>

Make sure to include {delimiter} to separate every step.

```python
user_message = f"""
by how much is the BlueWave Chromebook more expensive \
than the TechPro Desktop"""

messages =  [  
{'role':'system', 
 'content': system_message},    
{'role':'user', 
 'content': f"{delimiter}{user_message}{delimiter}"},  
] 

response = get_completion_from_messages(messages)
print(response)
```

    Step 1:#### The user is comparing the prices of two specific products.
    Step 2:#### Both products are available in the list of products provided.
    Step 3:#### The assumption made by the user is that the BlueWave Chromebook is more expensive than the TechPro Desktop.
    Step 4:#### The TechPro Desktop is priced at $999.99, and the BlueWave Chromebook is priced at $249.99. Therefore, the BlueWave Chromebook is $750 cheaper than the TechPro Desktop.
    Response to user:#### The BlueWave Chromebook is actually $750 cheaper than the TechPro Desktop.



```python
user_message = f"""
do you sell tvs"""
messages =  [  
{'role':'system', 
 'content': system_message},    
{'role':'user', 
 'content': f"{delimiter}{user_message}{delimiter}"},  
] 
response = get_completion_from_messages(messages)
print(response)
```

    Step 1:#### The user is asking about a specific product category, TVs, not a specific product.
    Step 2:#### N/A
    Step 3:#### N/A
    Step 4:#### N/A
    Response to user:#### We currently do not sell TVs. Our store specializes in computers and laptops. If you have any questions about our available products in that category, feel free to ask!


### Inner Monologue
- Since we asked the LLM to separate its reasoning steps by a delimiter, we can hide the chain-of-thought reasoning from the final output that the user sees.


```python
try:
    final_response = response.split(delimiter)[-1].strip()
except Exception as e:
    final_response = "Sorry, I'm having trouble right now, please try asking another question."
    
print(final_response)
```

    We currently do not sell TVs. Our store specializes in computers and laptops. If you have any questions about our available products in that category, feel free to ask!


## L5 Process Inputs: Chaining Prompts

- In this Lesson, We will learn how to split complex tasks into a series of subtasks by chaining multiple prompts together.
- **When to use Chaining Prompts instead Chain of Thought Reasoning Prompt?**
    - Chaining prompts breaks down a complex task making it easier to manage and reduce the likelihood of errors.
    - However This approach might be unnecessary and overcomplicated for a very simple task.
    - Chaining Prompts is a powerful strategy when you have a workflow where you can maintain the state of the system at any given point and take different actions depending on the current state 
    ![alt text](image-8.png)
    - Each subtask has the instructions required for a single state of the task which makes the system easier to manage, makes sure the model has all the information it needs to carry out a task and reduces the likelihood of errors.
    - It also Reduces number of tokens used in a prompt which lower costs, Also There is a Context Limitation(Max tokens for input prompt and output response) .
    - Skip some chains of the workflow when not needed for the task.
    - It is also easier to test which steps might be failing more often or to have a human-in-the-loop at a specific step.
    - For complex tasks, Keep track of state external to the LLM(In your code) and In ject instructions as needed.
    - It also allows the model to use external tools like WebSearch, Calling an api and Databases

    The SmartX ProPhone is a powerful smartphone with a 6.1-inch display, 128GB storage, 12MP dual camera, and 5G capability priced at $899.99. The FotoSnap DSLR Camera features a 24.2MP sensor, 1080p video, 3-inch LCD, and interchangeable lenses priced at $599.99. We also have a variety of TVs including the CineView 4K TV (55-inch, 4K resolution, HDR, Smart TV) for $599.99, the CineView 8K TV (65-inch, 8K resolution, HDR, Smart TV) for $2999.99, and the CineView OLED TV (55-inch, 4K resolution, HDR, Smart TV) for $1499.99. Is there a specific feature or aspect you would like more information on?

- In the Example above, We can look up information by exact product and category name match, but there are also more advanced techniques for information retrieval.
- One of the most effective ways to retrieve is using Text Embeddings. Embeddings can be used to implement efficient retrieval over a large corpus to find information related to a given query.
- One of the key advantages of using text embeddings is that they enable fuzzy or semantic search, Which allows you to find relevant information without using the exact keywords.

## L6: Check outputs

- In this lesson we'll focus on checking outputs by the system.
- Checking outputs before showing them to users can be important for ensuring the quality, relevance and safety of the responses provided to them or used in automation flows.

- As you can see, The model can provide feedback on the quality of a generated output, and you can use this feedback to decide whether to present the output to the user or to generate a new respons.
- You could even experiment with generating multiple model responses per user query and then having the model choose the best one to show the user.

## 7.Build an End-to-End System

This puts together the chain of prompts that you saw throughout the course.

### Setup
#### Load the API key and relevant Python libaries.
In this course, we've provided some code that loads the OpenAI API key for you.


```python
import os
import openai
import sys
sys.path.append('../..')
import utils

import panel as pn  # GUI
pn.extension()

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv

#### System of chained prompts for processing the user query


```python

### Function that collects user and assistant messages over time


```python
def collect_messages(debug=False):
    user_input = inp.value_input
    if debug: print(f"User Input = {user_input}")
    if user_input == "":
        return
    inp.value = ''
    global context
    #response, context = process_user_message(user_input, context, utils.get_products_and_category(),debug=True)
    response, context = process_user_message(user_input, context, debug=False)
    context.append({'role':'assistant', 'content':f"{response}"})
    panels.append(
        pn.Row('User:', pn.pane.Markdown(user_input, width=600)))
    panels.append(
        pn.Row('Assistant:', pn.pane.Markdown(response, width=600, style={'background-color': '#F6F6F6'})))
 
    return pn.Column(*panels)
```

### Chat with the chatbot!
Note that the system message includes detailed instructions about what the OrderBot should do.


```python
panels = [] # collect display 

context = [ {'role':'system', 'content':"You are Service Assistant"} ]  

inp = pn.widgets.TextInput( placeholder='Enter text here…')
button_conversation = pn.widgets.Button(name="Service Assistant")

interactive_conversation = pn.bind(collect_messages, button_conversation)

dashboard = pn.Column(
    inp,
    pn.Row(button_conversation),
    pn.panel(interactive_conversation, loading_indicator=True, height=300),
)
```

## 8.Evaluation part I
- After building the end-to-end system, How do you know it is working?,  How can you track how it's doing, find shortcomings and continue to improve the quality of the answers of your system?
    - Unlike building supervised machine learning models and evaluating it with a test set, Instead you often end up gradually building a set of test examples.
        1. When building an application using LLm, First you would tune the prompts on just a small handful of examples and try to get the prompt to work on them
        2. As your system undergo additional testing, You occasionally run into a few examples that are tricky, The prompt doesn't work on them.
        3. In that case, You can take these additional tricky examples to add them to the set that you are testing on.
        4. Then you start to develop metrics to measure performance on this small set of examples such as average accuracy.
        5. If your system is working well enough, you can stop right there.
        6. If not, You may want to collect a randomly sampled set of examples to tune the model to and this would be a development set or a hold-out cross-validation set.
        7. Bonus step, You collect and use a hold-out test sets that you don't look at when you are tuning your model.
    - A lot of LLm applications there isn't meaningful risk of harm if it not gives the right answer.
    - But for any high stake applications, If there's a risk of bias or an inappropriate output causing harm to someone, then the responsibilty to collect a test set to rigorously evaluate the performance of your system to make sure it's doing the right thing before you use it.

**Evaluate LLM responses when there is a single "right answer".**

### Setup

### Regression testing: verify that the model still works on previous test cases
Check that modifying the model to fix the hard test cases does not negatively affect its performance on previous test cases.


```python

## L9: Evaluation Part II

**Evaluate LLM responses where there isn't a single "right answer."**

### Setup
#### Load the API key and relevant Python libaries.
In this course, we've provided some code that loads the OpenAI API key for you.


```python
import os
import openai
import sys
sys.path.append('../..')
import utils
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file

openai.api_key  = os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']
```


```python
def get_completion_from_messages(messages, model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0, max_tokens=500):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=temperature, 
        max_tokens=max_tokens, 
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```

### Run through the end-to-end system to answer the user query

These helper functions are running the chain of promopts that you saw in the earlier videos.


```python
customer_msg = f"""
tell me about the smartx pro phone and the fotosnap camera, the dslr one.
Also, what TVs or TV related products do you have?"""

products_by_category = utils.get_products_from_query(customer_msg)
category_and_product_list = utils.read_string_to_list(products_by_category)
product_info = utils.get_mentioned_product_info(category_and_product_list)
assistant_answer = utils.answer_user_msg(user_msg=customer_msg,
                                                   product_info=product_info)
```


```python
print(assistant_answer) 
```
